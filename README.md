This script works with Adobe Illustrator. It breaks a selected block of text into separate blocks for each word
in th block by searching for spaces and other blank characters. The new text is placed in a layer called "Split
Text" in the upper left portion of the current artboard. Note that the text blocks are grouped and that spacing 
between words is approximate.
